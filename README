***********************
Lab 1 - Simpleton Shell
***********************
Makefile functionality:
* make: compiles program 'simpsh'
* make dist: packages files into tarball and does some checks
* make check: performs some simple tests on simpsh
* make clean: removes all files created from 'make' and 'test.sh'


simpsh functionality:
* Working options
	--rdonly
	--wronly
	--rdwr
	--pipe
	--close
	--command
	--verbose
	--brief (cancel verbose on rest of commands)
	--wait 
	--waitcmd (design problem 1b)
	--test (used to serialize all commands for verification testing)
	--pause
	--abort
	--catch
	--default
	--ignore
	--profile
* All oflags options supported
	--append
	--cloexec
	--creat
	--directory
	--dsync
	--excl
	--nofollow
	--nonblock
	--rsync
	--sync
	--trunc
* Flags are supported by pipes (as seen in pipe2 man page) (design problem 1b)
	--cloexec
	--nonblock
	--direct
* Profile gets resource data for the following options:
	--rdonly
	--wronly
	--rdwr
	--pipe
	--close
	--command
	--wait
	--abort
	--catch
	--default
	--ignore
* Profile reports the sum of all child resource usage when the --wait option is used
* Profile always reports the sum of all parent resource usage
* Verifies that the appropriate number of arguments are given
	--rdonly (1)
	--wronly (1)
	--rdwr (1)
	--close (1)
	--command (>= 4)
	--catch (1)
	--default (1)
	--ignore (1)
	--waitcmd (1)

	
Lab 1a TODO:
* N/A


Lab 1b TODO:
* N/A


Lab 1c TODO:
* perform test cases on all shells and compare results in document
* find out why 'time' cannot track execline in a script

Lab 1b Design Problem TODO:
* N/A

  
Notes:
* Option --test waits for each individual command to finish before starting a 
  new command (effectively serializing commands).  This is necessary for 
  verification testing only.
* In order to test pipes with --wait, it is necessary to use --close on the
  write ends of all pipes right before the --wait occurs.  Otherwise simpsh
  will hang, which is the expected behavior.
* Profile does not get resource data for...
	--verbose 
	--brief
	--test
	--pause
	  All oflag options
  The oflag options set a single integer flag (which would not be meaningful to 
  profile).  The test option is only used for verification testing.  The pause
  option could not be profiled because it stops simpsh until the user restarts
  it, and the resources collected from it would not be meaningful.
* Profile will only profile commands that come after it (similar to verbose).
  It should be placed as the first option for simpsh if you wish to profile all
  the options.
* Design Problem for lab 1b
  --pipe was extended to support flags (listed above).  This was really easy to
    implement, so that's why we did two design problems listed in the lab spec.
  --waitcmd N was added to wait for individual commands.  N is the command
    number you wish to wait for, with the first command starting at index 0.  It
	outputs the commands exit status and arguments in the same style as --wait.
