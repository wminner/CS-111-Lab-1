***********************
Lab 1 - Simpleton Shell
***********************
Makefile functionality:
* make: compiles program 'simpsh'
* make dist: packages files into tarball
* make check: performs some simple tests on simpsh
* make clean: removes all files created from 'make' and 'test.sh'

simpsh functionality:
* Working options
	--rdonly
	--wronly
	--command
	--verbose
	--brief (cancel verbose on rest of commands)	
	--wait (partially working)
* Verifies that the appropriate number of arguments are given
	--rdonly (1)
	--wronly (1)
	--command (>= 4)
* Can accept short arguments for commands (ex: "ls -l")
	
Lab 1A TODO:
* N/A

Notes  
* test.sh runs simpsh with the "--wait" option in order to avoid race conditions, 
  since there are multiple commands in tests and some depend on others.
* Option --wait not fully functional, but was added in to get more complex tests
  working.  It does not output the exit statuses of all the executed commands,
  but it does wait for child processes to finish. However implementing option
  --wait was not required for Lab 1A.

Known Issues
* None known
